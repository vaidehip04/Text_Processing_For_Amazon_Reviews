When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son. LOL\n",

She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.

We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!\n",

It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.

      "Review:  During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby's feedings, urination and bowel movements. However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box.\n",

      "Review:  My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.\n",

I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom.\n",

In India, the grandmothers start potty training the babies well around 4-5 months when they start sitting with support. In the same aspect, I got this chair just to make sure my son sits on the potty chair when parents use the bathroom and it worked very well. I am writing this review since I dint see any other reviews for kids as young as 6 months.The first day, as soon as me and my son got up, we went to the bathroom and sat on our own potty chairs, surprisingly, he peed in this, on the first day only! From then on we are repeating it every day and he seems to understand he has to pee to get out of that chair and hence does it. He likes to sit on this one, as it has the backrest, and armrest for both of his arms and his foot has not yet touched the floor but, its good enough for him. In a way, its good that his foot has not touched the floor yet, as he doesnt try to stand up :-). He has one of his squirty friends or a book in his hands to keep him happy. Even if he tries to reach for something on the either side, the chair doesnt trip and it holds well.Every single time, I put him on this, any time of day, he pees assuming thats what I want him to do. Pooping, we have not started yet, but so far it has been easy to clean and the splash guard does work great, remove the inner seat and wash it in warm water, and its even sanitized!Its been about a month since I got the first potty and here I am ready to buy my second one for the bathroom on the first floor. I got the Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty but he doesnt like it since it has no back or arm rest!

I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars.\n",

In all actuality i like the bottle, but my little Aliya loves it. After introducing her to Avent she rejected most other bottles, she wouldn't even take the new Ventair bottles. A great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Review:  When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that. Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak. NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby's face. Not only do you have to clean up but your baby doesn't want to wait for a new bottle. After slowly running out of bottles that didn't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect! They don't leak and our baby has less gas. The liners prevent a lot of gas. If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price. You get 100 of them for maybe $5.00. We haven't had any problems with leaking at all.So I don't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time. But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer, warmer, & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that doesn't mean they are all bad. I just had to give a warning so you don't lose a lot of money like we did.\n",

When my daughter was first born she was re-admitted to the hospital at 3 days for jaundice.  I had read that breat milk can increase or worsen jaundice so I pumped to save the milk for when she got out of the hospital.  The ice packs were definatly a plus and so was the cooler bag.  I had frozen just the bag to keep it cooler along with the ice packs and that really helped keep it colder longer.  The bottles that comes with it are ok.  I don't recommend Avent bottles for feeding but for storage they're perfect.  But if you prefer Avent you can just pop a nipple on the bottle and wha-la, ready to feed.  These bottles can go from pump, to fridge/freezer, to warmer, to bottle with not problem.As for the pump, once you get used to assembling it its a breeze.  It's also VERY comfortable to use with or without the &quot;petals&quot;.  I NEVER had a problem with not pumping (or producing) enough milk.  This also came in handy and quickly reduced engorgement for me.  All I had to do was pump for about 5  min on each side and it was instant relief and baby latched on better.I highly recommend this pump for everyone.  It's comfortable, efficient, whisper quiet, and easy to clean and put together.  A must have.\n",

      "Review:  I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours.\n",

      "Review:  I am sold on the Avent Isis Breast Pump--it works great for me.  I nursed my 2nd child exclusively for 13 months, and I used this pump to express milk so that my husband could feed him.  He never really took on the bottle, but that's a different story.  Anyway, I just couldn't justify having to spend a couple of hundred dollars for a pump--maybe if I was working and wanted to continue breastfeeding, I probably would have.  But I was a stay at home mom and just used the pump to express every now and then.  I had no problem expressing 4 ounces of milk in about 10 minutes, and it didn't hurt either--it actually felt comfortable.  I had the Evenflo electric pump for my first child--now that one was very uncomfortable--it felt like it was sucking the life out of you.  Maybe it was me being a first time mom, but I swore off that pump.  I still nursed my first child for 13 months but not exclusively--he got both breastmilk and formula.Now, I am on my 3rd child.  I figured after having such an easy time breastfeeding my 2nd child, it would be a piece of cake the 3rd time around.  Well, it wasn't.  She did not latched on properly and I got really sore within the first couple of days.  But I did not want to give up breastfeeding, so I purchased another one of the Avent Isis Breast Pump, because I wanted to help increase my milk supply.  It worked and I got to breastfeed again exclusively--my baby wasn't getting frustrated anymore because my milk supply increased.  Then when she was 6 weeks old, I had to leave her (unexpectedly) to attend my father's funeral in California.  I couldn't take her with me--she was too young.  I was gone for 3 days, and I did not want my milk supply to dwindle down, so this pump helped a lot.  I was able to express some before I left so she would have some breastmilk along with formula supplement while I was gone.  And then I pumped while I was gone--I did it on the plane restroom and airport restrooms very discretely, and I was done in about 15 minutes at a time.  And because it is manual, I was able to express whenever and whereever I needed to.  This helped me  keep my milk supply while I was gone so when I got back, I just continued on like I was not gone.  Thanks Avent.\n",

While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!\n",

Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in. He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh, he loves playing with wings of two butterflies (rattle and crinkle) and  tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them. At 7,5 months old, he enjoys up to an hour  in it playing there on his own (he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels.

It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.\n",

      "Review:  I like these smartly-designed bottles a lot.  They have reduced my son's colic and gas discomforts dramatically by reducing the amount of air he takes in while feeding.  My son is primarily breastfed, but my wife and I supplement his breastfeedings with pumped breastmilk and with formula.  The Original Nursers are made from polypropylene, which is a BPA-free plastic.  The liners are also BPA-free although I'm not sure what kind of plastic they are manufactured from.  Unlike some other corporations in the baby products industry, Playtex Baby is serious about customer support.  I have called the customer service number several times now and have gotten to talk to a knowledgeable person in every instance.  If you want to experiment with these bottles to see if they will work for you, I would suggest that you stop in at Target or Walmart.  They sell trial bottles for under $4 that come with either a latex or silicone nipple and 5 drop-in liners.  Unfortunately, the trial bottles that come with silicone nipples are the premium nursers, which are made from polycarbonate, a non-BPA-free plastic (this isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me because the milk never comes into contact with the polycarbonate).\n",

      "Review:  I knew from the beginning that I would be using these bottles.  What I love is the convenience.  No bottle washing, just toss out the liner and wash the nipple.  It's especially nice when you're out and about or a long trip and cannot necessarily wash a bottle after use.  What's nice about this starter kit is that it comes with 5 different nipples of varying flows and types (latex and silicone) that I was able to try without having to purchase separately (this is good because of my complaint below).I also like the Playtex one step storage system that you can use with these bottles (refer to my review on Playtex one step storage kits: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSCK6EN7AYRA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm).  With the pump adapter that comes in the storage kits, you can pump directly into the liners.I do have a few complaints about these bottles, though:!) As I mentioned, it's nice that it came with all the different nipples because finding the best one to use with my baby was a chore and a half (refer to my reviews on the Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow latex, Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow silicone, and Playtex NaturaLatch Orthodontic Medium Flow).2) The clear liners make it difficult to see the exact amount that is in the liner if you are pumping directly into the liner, but you learn to estimate more or less.  When you're breastfeeding you have no clue the exact amount the baby is getting anyways.  If you're really anal, just pump into a regular bottle and transfer to drop-in liner.3) Although convenient, the disposable liners do create a lot of waste.  This would be my biggest complaint.Overall, happy with product because of the convenience.\n",

      "Review:  I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all\n",

      "Review:  These bottles are fantastic in reducing gas.  My 5 week old has been using them since he was 1 week old and he has much less gas and spitting up when we use them as opposed to some other brands that we have tried.  I know these bottles have been around for a long time and now I understand why..they work.  I have found most of the new modern bottles to be all gimic and no substance.  The down side to these bottles is that you have to continually buy the bags which can get pricy.  It is also a little harder to travel with them because you have to bring the bottle, the bag, the water, and the formula all separate.  Futhermore, they don't come with caps for the nipples so you have to put your finger on the nipple to shake the formula and bag the nipple to travel with it.  I would tell anyone if they have been using Dr. Brown's, Avent, or any of the other super fancy feeding systems and their kids are still having problems with gas and spitting up, they should try these.\n",

The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents.  Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle;  we've used Avent with no problems.\n",

      "Review:  During my first pregnancy I received a Night and Day bottle warmer as a gift.  I had triplets and the Night and Day bottle warmer could not hold the number of bottles I needed at night so I ended up giving it away.  I would not recommend this product for homes with multiples.  You might be able to use it if you have twins and they only get up once during the night.When I became pregnant a second time, one of the first things I asked for was a Night and Day Bottle warmer.  There are not too many models out there.It is a very simple to use and set up.  The two water holders slide onto the side of the warmer and the cooler is placed in the back.  There are a couple of different basket holders.  One for bottles and one for jars of food.There is a chart on the side of the cooler.  You find the size bottle you are using and what type.  You fill the water to the number on the water holder.When you want to warm a bottle you dump the water into the warmer place the bottle in and hit the button.  Button will glow orange as it warms.  When it is ready the light will shut off.  Takes about 2-5 minutes.Good Features:On and Off switch on the cord.  Very nice when you have toddlers that like to push buttons.Indicator light to tell you when bottle is done.Warms a bottle in the amount of time it takes you to change the diaper.Very stable.  No tipping and not top heavy even with coolerFits many size bottles, See note below about Dr Brown's BottlesPoor Features:Water holder clips can break during shipping, inspect your warmer as soon as you buy itWater bottle for cooler, must fill with water.  Does not stay frozen for longer than 7-8 hours.Cooler lock is plastic bump.  Breaks very easily.  Cooler will no longer lock if one is missing.  Steam can get into cooler because seal is broken.  Top will not stay on if lock is broken.Will only hold 2 bottlesDr. Brown's BottlesUnscrew the top just enough so it does not have a complete seal, then warm bottle.  If you do not unscrew the top or remove the straw, the formula during heating will rise up the straw and flow into the warmer.When I opened the box I discovered one of the water holders was broken.  It was just the plastic clip on the side.  Then a few nights later I noticed that the lock on the cooler was broken.  I emailed First Years and told them about my broken pieces.  I never received a written response but a week later a new cooler and water holder arrived in the mail.The Night and Day Bottle warmer is a must have for Families that have 2 story homes or very large homes.  It is very convenient to remove the bottle from the cooler, place in warmer hit start.  Better than going to the kitchen and warming a bottle.*update* 8 oz Dr Brown's Bottles will not fit into the cooler unless you remove the cap.\n",

      "Review:  I used these with my now 3 year old b/g twins and my now 8 month old b/b twins. My boys still use these, though now we also mix in some other cheaper bottles and use these mainly for bedtime. They really were easier to clean, because food didnt get stuck on the bottom, and they really kept the gas at bay. My sons still nurse occasionally and get breastmilk, and they will take ANY bottle nipple, but for a while this was the ONLY one they would take, so I consider it their favorite. These bottles are really easy to use, and they are, in fact easier to clean! They fit in my Avent bottle sterilizer and they are a nice shape to get the milk easier. I recomend these for all new moms. Though there are many parts, they work MUCH better than the avents and live up to their word that they make gas much less frequent and a problem.\n",

I never could get her to  take to these bottles. If she had to spend any length working to get her food on the slower nipples, she'd turn around and really scream if I tried to nurse her since she was too tired and gassy. Faster flow, gagging child and still lot of gas.I loved the way they broke down, but the plastic inserts and the angles never did seem to do anything better about gas than my Avent bottles. It was honestly when I used the wide mouth Handi-craft Dr. Brown bottles that I started really noticing a difference. If you nurse too.... her latch got better with the Dr. Brown's, and after getting rid of these.\n",

The bottle is incredibly easy to clean because both ends can be removed.I unscrewed the nipple ring and the bottom of the bottle. I was so sure that it would leak if I put anything liquid in it. I filled the bottle full of water and tossed it around on a white sheet to see if it leaked. It didn't, but I still wasn't sure. So, I washed the bottle in hot water. I've noticed that some bottles leak after being washed. Then, I tried the sheet experiment again. It didn't leak. This bottle is 9 months old and still hasn't leaked.I also liked how these bottles were wide and took similar nipples as the disposable bottles from Playtex, which makes switching back and forth from the Playtex disposable and reusable bottles much easier and causes less nipple confusion.\n",

      "Review:  I can't speak to the 'science' behind the design and if the 'ventAire' does what it claims to. But they are a good well-designed bottle that our daughter likes. They are different then most bottles as there is not only the nipple and nipple ring on top but 2 pieces on the bottom that comprise the 'ventAire' system. I thought at first this would be a hassle but it is not much extra work to clean (more pieces to keep track of though). In fact it makes cleaning the bottle itself possible with a sponge since with the bottom and top pieces taken off you can put a sponge in from either end.If you are new to bottles though I do highly recommend this as an essential piece of baby equipmentOXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, OrangeThe bottle brush has gotten us up to 15 months, could not have done bottles without it. It helps for these as well although it is not essential as it is for regular bottles. In the end our daughter took right to these and the nipples on the 9 ounce ones seem to flow well for an older baby.

She keeps a supply of breast milk in the fridge. Of course, I must warm up the milk and we purchased \"The First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer\" for that purpose. It's handy and easy to use, even in my sleep-deprived condition.I'm not totally satisfied with this product. First of all, the cap holder broke off the little measuring vile almost right from the start. There's no way to fix it. Oh well, fixing it isn't essential, but it gives me the feeling that this bottle warmer might be a cheap piece of junk. Secondly, the bottle warmer heats the milk too hot if the instructions are followed precisely. Experimenting a bit, I have found that if four ounces of milk are to be heated to the desired temperature in the bottle, then the little measuring vile for water (added to the warmer) should be filled only to three. Go figure. Once you get that little calibration problem worked out, everything seems to work satisfactorily. Using it is fairly quick and easy. Otherwise, the warmer is nice looking and easy to keep clean. Hopefully it will last as long as needed.Gary Peterson\n",

      "Review:  We had no idea there were so many (confusing) options to buying a gate. This was the ONLY one that did what we needed without any extra bells and whistles. Because we were not using it around the stairs, we wanted a metal gate, that was pressure mounted, and swung open - easy, right??? Wrong!The only other one we could find in the stores is Evenflo's gate with a remote. We really didn't want to have a situation where the electronics might fail (or just need new batteries), so this gate was the winner. It took minutes to install and it couldn't be easier to use (I was weary of the foot petal at first). It clicks shut easily with just a swing of the gate. Just make sure you use the instructions to install it so you have the correct tightness for the latch (they provide a wrench that takes out the guesswork).The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the width. Many models go wider and you have to purchase an extension for larger openings (i.e. our \"I thought, standard\" hallway). Because it fits smaller openings, it makes for a very narrow gate. I would prefer they made two models so you're not left with a small opening while walking through a larger hall.Otherwise - it's THE gate to have for non-stair situations!!!\n",

      "Review:  I would highly recommend this gate!  We are using it at the bottom our basement stairs, and it is just what we needed.  Installation was not difficult at all.  I would recommend reading through the entire instruction booklet and looking at the pictures in the back first, but the entire installation only took me about 15 minutes, and that was with my 3 year old helping me.Things I love:1.  Nice wide gate (the part that swings open is wider than any other gate I have seen.  This is very helpful when trying to get through with a baby on one hip and a laundry basket on the other)2.  Secure latch (I have a 3 year old and an 11 month old, and my 3 year old can open a different gate we have, and sometimes forgets to shut it.  This gate requires more strength to open it, which means I am confident leaving the kids to play while I am in the next room)3.  Ease of installation (seriously, this was a very easy install requiring no additional tools)Things I would improve:1.  The height of the gate.  My 3 year old is an escape artist, and he has already figured out that he can push several toys over to the gate and climb over it.  Not too big of a deal since he can safely climb up and down the stairs, but it doesn't keep him contained at all.2.  The instruction booklet that comes with the gate.  the booklet has instructions in several different languages in the front, and then referneces pictures that are in the back of the book.  This means that you must constantly flip pages when reading the instructions.  I understand why they did it (1 set of pictures for several different languages), but it would be nice to have the corresponding pictures located on the same page as the instructions.All in all I would definately recommend this gate to anyone!\n",

We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between.  Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter.

      "Review:  I used these with my first daughter almost 7 years ago (although they were not BPA free back then...that was before it became a big deal I guess!)... and exclusively breastfed. I pumped my milk so dad could feed her when I was at work or college.  NEVER had any problem between bottlefeeding and breastfeeding - no nipple confusion, etc.  Gas wasn't a big problem either. They are so easy to clean - no scrubbing the bottle just drop in liners. Just have to clean the base/nipple/ring, but super easy and used to throw in the dishwasher.  Easy to store breastmilk in liners or bags and just pop them in the bottle after thawing. After 7 years could have still used my same bottles but opted to buy new ones because they were not BPA free.I also bought some AVENT bottles this time around - because that is the brand of pump I bought - and they are pretty good too. But these Playtex bottles are my go to bottle as they are SOOOO easy to clean and that is very important when you have a young, hungry, crying baby to take care of! :)\n",

      "Review:  Last year, in preparation to our son's arrival, we bought several leading, what I will call \"bottle feeding systems\" (You are not buying just bottles, but also committing yourself to the accessories specific to that brand, so they are systems).  The ones we chose to try were:-Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle-Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottles- ThesePlaytex, although in concept very appealing, we did not like because due to their design/material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted.  Also, it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see.  We stopped using these very quickly.  Although, if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk, these might be work much better.  Plus, Target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like, so that helps a lot with the price.Avent bottles are generally very good, and we ended up using them a lot.  Also, we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedPhilips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kitto be able to use the bottles withMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump.  The setup works great.  The main problem with the Avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring, the milk will leak all over your child. With the ring in, we never had a leak. We have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples N-4, and the above comments apply to all variations.Dr. Brown's bottles are probably the best out of the three.  Like the Avent, we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples 1-4.  With its design, it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces.  We have never had these bottles leak.  The complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded.  We never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher.  After about nine months of use, some of the markings are slightly coming off, not a big deal.  Also, the number of parts (6 vs Avent's 5 counting the lid) is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim.There seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas.  All of them reduced some, but not all.  Likewise, our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these, although he absolutely hatedThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, so we only tried it once.If I had to pick only one of the above brands, it would be Dr. Brown's.\n",

      "Review:  Let me start by saying this is a great concept. I purchased these bottles before my son, who is now 10 weeks old, was born. I planned to breastfeed exclusively. I planned to pump into these bottles. I even took a reviewers advice and got extra large bottles and short liners (which I wouldn't advise to anyone). I liked the idea of not needing to wash a million bottles. I didn't have a dishwasher at the time. (We now do... and maybe I would have stuck with these had that not been the case). I also have a psychotic cat that continually custom selected baby items from the dish drying rack. Drove me nuts.Nothing went to plan. I ended up supplementing my breast milk with formula after one month. My son eats a ton and these bottles don't really do well with formula.POWDERED FORMULAPowdered formula (which I can't stand) doesn't mix well in this bottle. Also, despite the wonderful design for keeping air out... you have to shake powdered formula. Thus, there's air in there and your baby will be gassy.LIQUID (RTF) FORMULAFormula is expensive. Pushing the air out of the bag is a GREAT concept. But when the bag exploded on me twice... I was upset. And reading reviews, I have to say I thought people were just pushing to quickly and clearly that would never happen to me. But it did. Twice. And with a screaming baby... it's really better to have bottles that are ready to go. (Even if prepared, you need to push air out of the bottle... and that takes time).BREASTMILKI don't pump enough to fill these bottles. Pumping takes a lot of time. So.. After I pump my four ounces, I don't want it to explode. And I don't want it to go bad from having so much exposure to air... And if I'm pumping, I'm not feeding my child right away. He eats all the time. Thus, I stopped \"expressing\" because it seemed to be a waste of time. Why pump into a bottle just to feed it to him right away? (I'm empty after I finish pumping). Now... in the first few weeks, my son killed my nipples. So, pumping into the bottle came in handy. The pump was much kinder. I didn't care if he destroyed silicone. (He didn't... but I'm just sayin'!).I had no problem with the lids on these bottles. I actually prefer these caps to the \"newer\" ones I found at Babies R Us (for a much higher price). The plastic is sturdy. I liked the silicone nipples because I could boil them (and now I can put them in the dishwasher). This brand is kind of wonderful because they make a variety of bottles and the nipples can be used with different bottles.I didn't hate the bottle enough to say you shouldn't try it. But I didn't like it enough to continue using it. You do not need \"extra\" exterior bottles. The set comes with enough. The comparison would be like buying a bunch of vaccuums for your vaccuum bags. Since you don't need to wash the exterior anyway... what you have is plenty.\n",

      "Review:  I've got a 2 week old.  We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles.  Great bottles, but the nipple was way too large for my son's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip.  So I tried Gerber for newborns...smaller nipple, but more bubbles and gas for baby.  So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas.  But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it.  Then I realized that the nipple doesn't just have a hole in it like other bottles do.  It has the slit-type hole, and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything's going to come out.  Well babies don't suck that way.  They suck at the wider part, naturally.  But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle.  (They tell you not to do this.) But it works perfectly now...no gas, no sucking problems.

Not bad when you have a hungry baby screaming in the middle of the night.

Every one I have given it to; have loved it as much as I have.  Warm formula always hits baby's spot and helps with gas and spit up problems. I have found it worked well for my refrigerated breast milk and my transition to formula so I can recommend it to both breastfeeding moms and moms who choose to feed with formula (both powdered and premixed canned).

It's so hard to get a newborn/infant's footprint without them curling up their toes and pulling all of the clay with it, but we finally got them on our twins. We bought two sets, one for each child. The first went smoothly and we nailed it after the 3rd try. The second was more challenging, and eventually the clay hardened to a point where it was no longer usable and we still hadn't got the footprint. We called the company and they mailed us a replacement clay free of charge. The lady on the phone was very supportive and offered a few tips. Ultimately, what worked for us is preparing the clay on waxed paper, using the wood rolling stick over waxed paper to prevent it from sticking to the clay, pressing the foot firmly but quickly into the clay and quickly pulling it back up in a straight manner. I then placed a piece of waxed paper lightly over the print and used my finger to smooth out any wrinkles in the clay and then transferred it onto a piece of foil to lay while it dried. This was a really stressful experience. I wish there was an easier way to get footprints, but even though it sucked doing, I'm glad we did it. We now have their prints captured in clay forever.\n",

We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders.  Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone.  But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room.  I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor.Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap.\n",

      "Review:  This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!\n",

      "Review:  We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.  We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!  I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month.\n",

We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors.

I do think the on-off switch is a blessing for the parents.  But the music is really pleasant, unlike so many toys.Of course the music is electronic, and I think that would be my only complaint.  I'm a very amateur violinist and would like the violin button to truly sound like strings but instead it's very electronic.However, the piano and French horn are quite good facsimiles.Research tells us that early introduction of classical music to children aids in their developing cognitive abilities.

      "Review:  My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays (ie. Tot-Loc, First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat, and First Years Folding Booster...all great products by the way)  She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl, and she didn't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays.  We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here, we decided to give it a try, but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child.  Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster.  The booster wipes clean very easily, sticks to the chair very well, and the seat itself is non-slip, so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters.  Best of all, the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table (much better fit than the hard plastic boosters) and she appears to be much more comfortable (not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now).  This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better.  Also, the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch, and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster.  We're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years, and since it's so portable, we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention, I wouldn't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and doesn't like to sit still.  My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied, but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age, I wouldn't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in.\n",

It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to \"grip\" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work.

I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!

      "Review:  This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you're looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole. We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up, although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred. We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter, who has just reached her first birthday. Of the two, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, although neither has caused the dreaded \"nipple confusion.\" In both cases, we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type. This is how the two compare:1. The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with. Throw out the old liner, pop in a new one, fill it up, and you're ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby. No bottle brush or hot, soapy water needed.2. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).3. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider, and if she falls asleep, the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets, and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both. For convenience and fast clean-up, the Playtex Drop-In system wins. For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy, the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote.\n",

My baby girl had colic and gas from day one and was up all night crying until my mother heard about Dr. Brown's bottles and urged me to try them. The colic/gas stopped on the very first day I used them, words cannot describe that feeling. I do recommend skipping the purchase of the 4 oz. bottles and going staight to the 8 oz. ones to save some $$, just don't fill them all the way up until necessary, they sell extra nipples in various levels. And as for the other reviews complaining that they leak and are hard to clean and expensive: if you assemble them correctly and do not overfill, they won't leak, and the 2 extra parts are WELL WORTH the extra time to clean, but they are not \"hard\" to clean, I soak in hot soapy water and rinse, rarely do I have to use the brush thing, and they are really no more expensive than other bottles, well worth it and plus you can save by just using these instead of trying all the others. TRUST ME DR. BROWN'S ARE FABULOUS !! I have been using them for 2 months now and I am so happy I agreed to try them. Among the others that I had previously tried were the Avent and Playtex VentAire bottles but Dr. Brown's were the only \"anti-colic\" bottles that worked.

Recently, I discovered that I could use the nipple and handle on regular Avent bottles that we already had. This was great for when I fell behind on doing dishes... I simply rinsed the nipple attachment and put it on the Avent bottles. It also allowed us to bring along a few different drinks on trips and simply move the nipple/handle to the different drinks depending on what he wanted.I've not had a problem with leaking or losing parts... I'm not sure why some would find them hard to take apart? It has like three peices? Leaking hasn't been an issue at all, in fact these were the only type I had that didn't leak. Of course they have to be assembled right to not leak. If you forget the valve, they will leak.I particularly like the spout design which allows him to drink without getting solids into the cup. When he drank during his meals with the Gerber cup, all sorts of particles would end up in the cup. Not so with this one.\n",

We're on our second car seat now, and I've helped install others for friends, and every car seat has its own installation quirks. At some point, with all of them, if you're using seat belts to hold down the car seat, you're going to have to tighten the belt significantly. When I install our car seat (before the Mighty Tite), that means getting up on it and bearing down a lot of weight while tugging on it; when my wife does it, it means not being able to get a really tight fit at all.\"After\" we got the Mighty Tite, and went through the use of it, I'd say our car seat installation time was reduced by 200%, and the installation job was much more secure. During a recent spate of traveling, we had to install and re-install the seat a dozen times in a two-week period, and this was utterly essential for getting on and off of the airplane quickly while still having a securely-installed seat, and even more importantly, getting the seat re-installed securely when we were putting it into a \"strange\" car.We particularly appreciated the plastic instructions attached to the Mighty Tite with a metal ring -- it meant when we got confused about how to use it with a different belt arrangement, we had the visual reference right at hand and not all dog-eared or ripped up (like our car seat installation manual!)Obviously, if you're only going to install the car seat once in one car there may be diminishing returns on a device like this. But if you have to move it even occasionally, I think this accessory is worth the price for a little extra security and peace of mind, plus a few extra minutes saved.The one caveat I provide is that the plastic retainers that hold the strap in have begun to look a little stressed (the way well-used plastic looks before it breaks), so this might not wear well over a multi-year period. This is not a safety issue, since this part is used only to guide the safety belt, and if it does break, it will still be usable. Still, one would hope it will not! Since we've already put it to heavy use, though, I'm well satisfied at the purchase and value.\n",

To add comfort I have a waterproof pad under it which I think is a must in playards anyways because it is not easy to clean the matress pad they come with.I have had no problems with bleeding, and I wash it very often and it has held up fine.\n",

      "Review:  I have been through 4 brands of disposables and also have several pairs of these. At first when I was sore and using nipple cream, I used the disposables. The yellow cream stains, so I didn't want to mess up my good pads. After I no longer needed cream, I moved on to the washable ones. I think they are so much softer and more comfortable than the disposables. I forget that I even have them on. I agree with other posters that they may not be as discreet as some of the disposables, but I don't really care. I don't wear too many tight clothes these days and if I did I could use disposables (to me the J&J and Avent disposables are the most discreet). I don't leak much anymore, so these are plenty sufficient to collect leakage. I have four pair. I generally do laundry once a week, with one load at some point mid-week. I'm able to always have some on hand.\n",

      "Review:  This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it.  The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric.  The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel.  I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though.  Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad.  You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one.  I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.\n",

      "Review:  These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse.\n",

      "Review:  I love these liners. They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk. I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere. I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all. My only complaints are: 1. They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho. 2. The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk. Otherwise, this is a great product!!\n",

      "Review:  For the first few days of my son's birth, we had the wide-neck Avent bottles which leaked, the nipples gave him suction blisters on the lips, he needed extensive burping and he would find it difficult to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in those bottle.  Dr Brown's bottles solved all these issues.I have six bottles and it takes me less than 20 minutes to wash them by hand.  It takes some getting used to washing the small parts, but it's worth the extra effort.  The small brush which comes with the starter kit is essential to clean the small parts.  A regular bottle brush is fine for the bottles themselves.  Save yourself the money and go straight for the 8oz bottles.  The starter kit comes with Level-1 nipples.  You will likely need to graduate your baby to Level-2 niplles at 3-months of age and Level-3 nipples at 6-months of age.  Y-cut nipples are also available for thicker liquids (cereal mixed in milk).If you leave expressed breast-milk in these bottles in the refigerator, the fat tends to stick to the vent (just as a FYI).  Use the travel-discs when transporting milk and there will be no leaks.  My baby hardly needs burping with these bottles, they are that great (he doesn't have reflux by the way).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only con I can think of.I highly recommend these bottles. I've suggested these bottles to two of my friends whose babies have refulx and they have seen an improvement.  Try some other websites, which have better prices and offer the 9-pack variety.  If you're paying shipping, might as well get some extra small brushes, you'll need them.  One lasts for about 6-8 weeks.\n",

      "Review:  I'll preface this by saying that I'm sure that every child has individual preferences in these things, so your experience may vary. That said, none of the purported benefits of this plate and spoons provided any advantage to my son. He prefers metal silverware (the spoons are narrower and easier to fit into a little mouth) and a smaller plate (less chasing food around). So while these are perfectly adequate, I wouldn't buy them again, especially not at the infamously high BabyBjorn prices.Also, please note that the large base for this plate may not fit onto smaller high chair trays (such as our keekaroo). I haven't downrated the product because of this, as the dimensions are listed right in the description, but thought it worth pointing out.For reference, here's the silverware and plate that we prefer:http://www.amazon.com/Oneida-Chateau-6-Piece-Progress-Flatware/dp/B000NDQ3DC/ref=pd_sim_sbs_ba_3http://www.amazon.com/OXO-6104800-Tot-Plate-Aqua/dp/B0038JDURU/ref=sr_1_1_m?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1358632535&sr;=1-1&keywords;=oxo+tot+plate\n",

And i like the remote, though i don't usually have to use it because it plays long enough for her to fall asleep.  As far as the reviewer who said it doesn't fit the crib, that is valid.  It doesn't fit the top rail of our crib, but we just put the mobile flat against the slats in the crib and screwed the other side through the slats.  It has worked fine for us, just make sure it is tight.the reason i had to give it only 3 stars (and the only reason) is that we had to return it 3 times to get one that worked!  and we called Sassy to see if they could help us with it and they never returned our phone call!  I wasn't very impressed.  But Babiesrus was great about taking it back and they never questioned us for returning it 3 times!\n",

In a desperate attempt at finding something new, I grabbed some of these Take and Toss cups figuring there wasn't much to lose considering how cheap they were.I was very excited to see that they said they were dishwasher safe...meaning, they'll probably last just fine for more than one use.I've only had them a couple of days and I'm SO happy I got them.  They're working out great for my 18 month-old and it's great to know that if I'm ever in a situation when one gets broken, lost, or just gets all funky and gross, I WON'T feel bad about throwing it out!The only downsides to these cups have been mentioned in other reviews -- the lids are a little difficult to get on (but I remind myself this means my daughter will probably never get it off by herself) and they do leak if you shake them upside-down.Seriously, give these a shot before dropping $6+ on ONE sippy cup.

It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well.  I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small.  I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips; it probably wouldn't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets.  I found it relatively easy to open and close.  I don't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself, and she won't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself.  I now own at least five of these.\n",

We leave a lap pad on the cover which is the first line of defense against accidents during changes.  This somewhat reduces the frequency of cover washings.  Some people have noted that they find these covers unnecessary- I'm sure the changing pad would be adequate by itself, but I just feel like the whole area is cleaner when I can throw the cover and pad into the laundry.Be advised that all our covers did shrink slightly after washing.  They do, however, continue to fit well on the pad.  The colors also faded slightly with washings.\n",

The liner and the nipple are the only things that come in contact with milk - the liner is disposed off after one use, and the nipple can be easily sterilized.This system works particularly well when traveling. I introduced these to my son when he was 2.5 months old and we were on a flight for 16 hours. I simply took 2 nurser bottles, lots of liners, and many nipples. Made cleaning super easy on the flight - and gave me the piece of mind that everything was sterilized. The biggest advantage was that my luggage was a lot less bulky (as opposed to traveling with 8 glass bottles).The only downside: The 1 oz, 2 oz, 3 oz etc markings on the nurser are not correct. You should use another system of measurement to figure out how much milk/water you want to pour in the nurser.\n",

However, there are still many clusters containing reviews which do not lend themselves to any particular category.
