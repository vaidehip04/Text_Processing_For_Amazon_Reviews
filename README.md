# Text_Processing_For_Amazon_Reviews

# In this problem set we will explore bag-of-words (BOW) and text processing , learn the TF-IDF transform,  understand k-means clustering in terms of coding, get more experience with matrix manipulations.

# We are using a dataset of Amazon reviews. It is compiled of three topics and contains ~200k reviews. We will read those, convert into TF-IDF form, and use k-means clustering to analyze the results. Finally, check the resulting clusters and see how well-defined are the clusters. 

# When implemented well, the code runs ~30 iterations in a few minutes for 10k reviews, the memory consumption is ~2G per 10k reviews.
